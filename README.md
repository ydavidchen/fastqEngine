## Inspiration

## What it does

* Let user select RNA-seq raw data files (*.fastq* format), often from people with diseases such as cancer
* Operates locally -- no risk of exposing data files potentially subject to privacy and/or intellectual property (IP) rights

## How I built it

* Use a whiteboard to brainstorm!
* Present my idea/progress periodically to others

## Challenges I ran into

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

* Make a solution to real-world problem that I personally encountered come true
* Being a "solo hacker" in a hackathon for the first time

## What I learned (beyond the organizational detail)

* Automate shell pipeline

## What's next for fastqEngine

* Scalability
* Implementation on remote computer cluster
* Implementation on cloud platform
* Adaptabiility as new experimental platforms come up
